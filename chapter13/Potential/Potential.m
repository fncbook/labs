%% You've got potential

%% 1. Solve for potential
theta = pi/5;
m = 144;  n = 144;
%*** Solve the PDE with given boundary data.

%*** Make a surface plot of the solution.

%% 2. Partial derivatives

%*** Plot the first partial derivatives of the solution.

%% 3. Equipotentials and gradient

%*** Make a combined contour/quiver plot.

%% 4. Another angle
theta = 3*pi/5;
%*** Repeat steps 1-3.
